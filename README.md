# HRAnalytics
The project's main objective is to help organizations understand how employees' work patterns and attendance are affected by the option of working remotely or taking sick leave, thereby aiding in decision-making processes related to WFH/SL policies. By identifying trends and patterns in the data, the project can offer actionable insights to organizations that can improve productivity and employee well-being.
